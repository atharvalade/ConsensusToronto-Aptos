## Privacy and Security Tips

1. **Never share your private keys or seed phrases** with anyone, including EcoChain support
2. Always verify transaction details before signing them
3. Use a dedicated wallet for carbon credit transactions

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

1. **Transaction Pending**: Aptos transactions are usually fast, but during network congestion, they may take longer. Check the transaction status in your wallet or the Aptos explorer.

2. **Wallet Connection Failed**: Try refreshing the page, ensure your wallet extension is up to date, or try connecting with a different supported wallet.

3. **Insufficient Funds**: Ensure you have enough APT to cover both the purchase amount and the transaction fee.

4. **Verification Data Not Updating**: IoT data verification can take several minutes to process. If it persists for more than an hour, contact support.
